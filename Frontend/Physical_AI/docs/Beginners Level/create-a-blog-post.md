# Documenting Physical AI Progress

In Physical AI and Robotics projects, it's important to **document your progress**, experiments, and findings through:

- Technical reports on robot behaviors
- Experiment results and analysis
- Iteration notes on AI algorithms
- Lessons learned during development

## Document your first Robot Experiment

Create a technical report at `reports/2025-02-28-robot-navigation.md`:

```md title="reports/2025-02-28-robot-navigation.md"

Initial results from our robot navigation experiments using ROS and Gazebo simulation.

The robot successfully demonstrated basic path planning and obstacle avoidance.

A new technical report is now available in your documentation system.

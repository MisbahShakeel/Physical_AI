# Congratulations!

You have just learned the **basics of Physical AI and Robotics** and created your first robot simulation environment.

Physical AI has **much more to offer**!

Have **5 more minutes**? Take a look at **Advanced Gazebo Simulation** and **ROS Integration** in the Intermediate Level tutorials.

Ready to dive deeper into robotics? Continue with the **Intermediate Level** tutorials.

## What's next?

- Explore the **Module 1-4 content** for in-depth topics
- Learn about **Gazebo Physics Simulation** in Module 2
- Implement more complex **Robot Control Algorithms** in Module 3
- Build **Humanoid Robot Models** in Module 4
- Integrate **AI and Machine Learning** with your robots in Module 4
- Join the [Physical AI Community](https://github.com/physical-ai/physical-ai) for support and collaboration

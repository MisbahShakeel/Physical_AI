# Deploy your Physical AI Documentation

Your Physical AI and Robotics documentation is a **static-site-generator** that creates **professional documentation** for your robotics projects.

It builds your documentation as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files** for easy sharing.

## Build your documentation

Build your documentation **for production**:

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

## Deploy your documentation

Test your production build locally:

```bash
npm run serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

You can now deploy the `build` folder to share your robotics documentation with your team, **for free** or very small cost (read the **[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)**).

This is essential for sharing your Physical AI research, robot specifications, and AI algorithm implementations with other researchers and engineers.

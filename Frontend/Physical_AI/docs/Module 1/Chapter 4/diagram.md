[Diagram: Physical AI - ROS 2 Joint Control Architecture for Humanoid Locomotion]

This diagram details the ROS 2 Control framework implementation for humanoid robot joint control systems. The visualization encompasses:

- **Hardware Interface Layer**: Direct communication with robot actuators and sensors
- **Controller Manager**: Central coordination for multiple simultaneous controllers
- **Control Types**: Position, velocity, and effort controllers for different manipulation requirements
- **Real-time Performance**: Timing constraints and control loop frequency considerations
- **Safety Systems**: Joint limits, trajectory validation, and emergency stop mechanisms

The diagram demonstrates how ROS 2 Control provides precise, real-time joint control necessary for stable humanoid locomotion and dexterous manipulation while maintaining system safety and reliability.

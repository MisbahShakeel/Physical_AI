[Diagram: Physical AI - Python Agent Integration with ROS 2 Control Systems]

This diagram illustrates the integration architecture between Python-based AI agents and ROS 2 control systems for humanoid robots. The visualization shows:

- **AI Decision Layer**: High-level reasoning and planning using Python-based machine learning frameworks
- **Bridge Interface**: rclpy-based communication layer that translates between Python AI outputs and ROS 2 messages
- **Control Interface**: ROS 2 control nodes that execute commands on the physical robot
- **Feedback Loop**: Sensor data flowing back to inform AI decisions

The diagram demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be effectively integrated with real-time robot control systems, enabling intelligent autonomous behavior while maintaining the reliability and real-time performance requirements of physical robot systems.

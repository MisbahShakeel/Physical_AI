[Diagram: Physical AI - URDF Kinematic Structure for Humanoid Manipulation Systems]

This diagram presents the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) representation for humanoid robot kinematics, focusing on manipulation systems. The visualization includes:

- **Link Definitions**: Rigid body components with mass, inertia, and visual/collision properties
- **Joint Hierarchies**: Revolute, prismatic, and fixed joints that define degrees of freedom
- **Kinematic Chains**: Forward and inverse kinematics computation paths
- **End-Effector Design**: Tool attachment points and manipulation capabilities

The diagram demonstrates how URDF enables accurate modeling of humanoid robot kinematics for both simulation and real-world control, supporting tasks like motion planning, collision detection, and dynamic simulation in Physical AI applications.

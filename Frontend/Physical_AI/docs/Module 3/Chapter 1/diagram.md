[Diagram: Physical AI - Cognitive Architecture for Humanoid Robot Intelligence]

This diagram presents the cognitive architecture for humanoid robot intelligence in Physical AI systems. The visualization details:

- **Perception Systems**: Multi-sensory input processing from cameras, LiDAR, tactile sensors, and other modalities
- **Memory Architecture**: Short-term working memory and long-term knowledge storage for context and learning
- **Reasoning Engine**: Logical inference, planning, and decision-making capabilities
- **Action Selection**: Motor control planning and execution coordination
- **Learning Mechanisms**: Continuous adaptation and improvement through experience
- **Embodied Cognition**: Integration of physical embodiment with cognitive processes

The diagram demonstrates how artificial intelligence and robotic systems are unified to create intelligent, adaptive humanoid robots capable of complex interactions with their environment through integrated cognitive and motor capabilities.

## Core Theory

### Introduction to AI-Robot Brain Architecture

The AI-robot brain represents a cognitive architecture that integrates artificial intelligence with robotic control systems to enable intelligent behavior. This architecture serves as the central processing unit for humanoid robots, combining perception, reasoning, planning, and action execution in a unified framework.

### Cognitive Architecture Components

A complete AI-robot brain consists of several interconnected components:

**Perception System:**
- Multimodal sensory processing (vision, audition, touch, proprioception)
- Feature extraction and representation learning
- Object detection and recognition
- Scene understanding and spatial reasoning
- Sensor fusion for robust perception

**Memory System:**
- Short-term working memory for immediate tasks
- Long-term episodic memory for experiences
- Semantic memory for knowledge representation
- Procedural memory for learned skills
- Memory consolidation and retrieval mechanisms

**Reasoning System:**
- Logical reasoning for symbolic tasks
- Probabilistic reasoning for uncertainty handling
- Causal reasoning for understanding effects
- Analogical reasoning for transfer learning
- Commonsense reasoning for everyday tasks

**Planning System:**

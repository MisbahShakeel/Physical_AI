[Diagram: Physical AI - Embodied Cognition Framework for Human-Robot Interaction]

This diagram presents the embodied cognition framework for human-robot interaction in Physical AI systems. The visualization encompasses:

- **Embodied Representation**: How the robot's physical form influences its cognitive processes
- **Sensorimotor Integration**: Coordination between sensory input and motor output for skilled behavior
- **Affordance Learning**: Recognition of environmental possibilities for action and interaction
- **Environmental Interaction**: Dynamic relationship between robot and environment for adaptive behavior
- **Body Schema**: Internal representation of the robot's physical configuration and capabilities
- **Context Awareness**: Understanding of environmental context and social situations

The diagram demonstrates how embodiment shapes artificial intelligence, creating robots that understand and interact with the world through their physical form and sensorimotor experiences, leading to more natural and intuitive human-robot interactions.

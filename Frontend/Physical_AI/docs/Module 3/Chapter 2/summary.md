## Key Takeaways

- **Embodied AI** represents a paradigm shift from traditional symbolic AI to systems that ground intelligence in physical interaction with the environment, emphasizing that cognition emerges from the dynamic interaction between body, brain, and environment.

- **Situated Cognition Principles** include context-dependent processing, action-oriented cognition, and distributed cognition, where cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the environment in which they occur.

- **Embodied Cognitive Architecture** integrates sensorimotor coordination, body schema integration, and environmental modeling to create systems that think and act through their bodies.

- **Affordance-Based Perception** focuses on action possibilities that the environment offers to an agent, enabling direct perception-action coupling and task-oriented processing.

- **Sensorimotor Learning** occurs through physical interaction, including reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and self-supervised learning approaches that ground intelligence in experience.

- **Morphological Computation** leverages physical properties of the body for computation, using passive dynamics, compliant control, and material intelligence for efficient robot control.

- **Ecological Psychology** principles guide robot design toward direct perception, Gibsonian approaches, and task-specific perception systems.

- **Situated Learning Systems** enable context-aware learning, embodied learning, and social learning that adapt to environmental contexts.

- **Environment-Aware Decision Making** considers environmental context in reasoning, spatial intelligence, and affordance-based planning for intelligent robot behavior.

- **Integration with Traditional AI** combines embodied and symbolic approaches through hybrid architectures, grounded symbol systems, and cognitive integration for comprehensive robotic intelligence.

## Review Questions

1. **Basic Understanding**: What is embodied AI and how does it differ from traditional symbolic AI approaches in robotics?

## Core Theory

### Introduction to Embodied AI

Embodied AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional symbolic AI to systems that ground intelligence in physical interaction with the environment. In robotics, embodied AI emphasizes that cognition emerges from the dynamic interaction between an agent's body, its control systems, and its environment.

### Principles of Situated Cognition

Situated cognition theory posits that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the environment in which they occur. For humanoid robots, this means:

**Context-Dependent Processing:**
- Cognitive processes adapt to environmental context
- Knowledge is tied to specific situations and actions
- Learning occurs through situated interaction
- Memory is context-dependent and embodied

**Action-Oriented Cognition:**
- Perception serves action and is shaped by it
- Cognitive processes are organized around behavioral goals
- Knowledge is procedural rather than purely declarative
- Intelligence emerges from sensorimotor coordination

**Distributed Cognition:**
- Cognitive processes extend beyond the brain/body boundary
- Environment plays an active role in cognitive processing
- Tools and artifacts become part of the cognitive system
- Intelligence is distributed across agent and environment

### Embodied Cognitive Architecture

An embodied cognitive architecture for humanoid robots includes:

**Sensorimotor Coordination:**
- Direct coupling between perception and action
- Real-time sensorimotor loops
- Predictive processing and forward models
- Adaptive sensorimotor mappings

**Body Schema Integration:**
- Representation of body configuration and kinematics
- Proprioceptive awareness and self-perception
- Body-environment interaction models
- Morphological computation utilization

**Environmental Modeling:**
- Affordance-based environmental representation
- Task-relevant environmental features
- Dynamic environmental adaptation
- Context-aware spatial reasoning

### Affordance-Based Perception

Affordances represent the action possibilities that the environment offers to an agent. In humanoid robotics:

**Action Possibilities:**
- Surfaces for support and manipulation
- Openings for passage and navigation
- Objects for grasping and interaction
- Spatial configurations for movement

**Perception-Action Coupling:**
- Direct perception of affordances
- Embodied feature extraction
- Task-oriented visual processing
- Motor-oriented spatial perception

**Affordance Learning:**
- Discovery of new affordances through interaction
- Generalization across similar situations
- Individual affordance calibration
- Social learning of affordances

### Sensorimotor Learning

Embodied AI systems learn through sensorimotor interaction:

**Reinforcement Learning:**
- Reward-based learning from environmental feedback
- Exploration-exploitation trade-offs
- Value function approximation

This embodied approach to AI creates humanoid robots that think and act through their bodies in interaction with their environments, leading to more natural, adaptive, and robust robotic intelligence.

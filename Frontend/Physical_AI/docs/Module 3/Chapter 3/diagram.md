[Diagram: Physical AI - Social Intelligence Architecture for Human-Robot Collaboration]

This diagram presents the social intelligence architecture for human-robot collaboration in Physical AI systems. The visualization details:

- **Social Signal Processing**: Recognition and interpretation of human gestures, facial expressions, and vocal cues
- **Theory of Mind**: Understanding human intentions, beliefs, and emotional states
- **Social Decision Making**: Planning appropriate responses based on social context and norms
- **Communication Modalities**: Multi-channel interaction through speech, gesture, and physical actions
- **Trust Building**: Establishing and maintaining human-robot trust through reliable behavior
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Adjusting interaction style based on cultural and individual preferences

The diagram demonstrates how humanoid robots can engage in natural, intuitive social interactions with humans, enabling effective collaboration in shared physical environments through sophisticated understanding of social dynamics and communication.

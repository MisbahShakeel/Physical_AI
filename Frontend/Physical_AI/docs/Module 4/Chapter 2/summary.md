## Key Takeaways

- **LLM-based cognitive planning** enables robots to interpret natural language commands and generate complex action sequences
- **ROS 2 integration** with LLMs requires careful attention to safety validation and plan filtering
- **Hierarchical planning** allows LLMs to decompose complex tasks into executable subtasks
- **Context-aware planning** considers robot state, environment, and task history for better decision making
- **Prompt engineering** is crucial for generating reliable and safe robot actions from LLMs
- **Safety mechanisms** must be implemented to validate LLM-generated plans before execution
- **Integration with traditional planners** combines LLM reasoning with geometric and motion planning
- **Evaluation metrics** should cover plan correctness, execution success, and safety compliance

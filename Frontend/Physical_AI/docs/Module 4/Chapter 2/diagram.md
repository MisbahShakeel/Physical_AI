[Diagram: LLM-driven cognitive planning loop for ROS 2 action sequencing]

This diagram illustrates the complete LLM-driven cognitive planning loop for ROS 2 action sequencing:

1. **Natural Language Input**:
   - User command in natural language
   - Voice or text input interface
   - Command preprocessing and cleaning

2. **LLM Processing**:
   - Large Language Model (e.g., GPT)
   - Prompt engineering and context provision
   - Intent recognition and task decomposition
   - Action sequence generation

3. **Plan Validation**:
   - Safety checks and feasibility validation
   - Robot capability verification
   - Environmental constraint checking
   - Collision avoidance integration

4. **ROS 2 Action Sequencing**:
   - Action decomposition into ROS 2 primitives
   - Service calls and action server interactions
   - Message generation and parameter setting
   - Execution planning and scheduling

5. **Robot Execution**:
   - Navigation and movement control
   - Manipulation and interaction systems
   - Sensor feedback integration
   - Real-time execution monitoring

6. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Execution status monitoring
   - Plan deviation detection
   - Success/failure reporting
   - Learning and adaptation mechanisms

The loop demonstrates how natural language commands flow through the LLM planning system to generate and execute ROS 2 action sequences, with continuous feedback for adaptive planning.

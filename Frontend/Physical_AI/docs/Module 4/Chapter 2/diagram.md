[Diagram: Physical AI - Advanced Cognitive Planning with LLMs for Humanoid Robot Control]

This diagram presents the advanced cognitive planning architecture using Large Language Models for humanoid robot control in Physical AI systems. The visualization encompasses:

1. **Natural Language Understanding**:
   - Multi-modal input processing (text, speech, gesture)
   - Context-aware language comprehension
   - Ambiguity detection and resolution
   - Intent and goal extraction from user commands

2. **Cognitive Reasoning**:
   - World modeling and environmental reasoning
   - Task decomposition into executable subgoals
   - Knowledge integration from multiple sources
   - Planning with uncertainty and incomplete information

3. **Action Planning and Validation**:
   - Robot kinematic and dynamic constraint checking
   - Multi-step plan feasibility verification
   - Safety protocol integration and validation
   - Resource allocation and scheduling optimization

4. **Execution Orchestration**:
   - Real-time action sequencing and coordination
   - Multi-modal feedback integration (visual, tactile, auditory)
   - Adaptive plan adjustment based on execution outcomes
   - Failure recovery and contingency planning

5. **ROS 2 Integration**:
   - Distributed system coordination and communication
   - Real-time performance optimization
   - Safety-critical system interfaces
   - Multi-robot coordination capabilities

6. **Learning and Adaptation**:
   - Plan execution outcome analysis
   - User preference learning and adaptation
   - Continuous improvement through experience
   - Knowledge transfer between tasks and environments

The diagram demonstrates how advanced cognitive planning systems enable humanoid robots to understand and execute complex natural language commands through sophisticated reasoning and adaptive planning mechanisms.

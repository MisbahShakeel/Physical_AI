[Diagram: Physical AI - Voice Command Processing Architecture for Humanoid Robots]

This diagram presents the comprehensive voice command processing architecture for humanoid robots in Physical AI systems. The visualization details:

1. **Audio Processing Pipeline**:
   - Advanced microphone array with beamforming capabilities
   - Real-time noise cancellation and acoustic echo suppression
   - Speaker identification and voice activity detection
   - Audio quality assessment and enhancement

2. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**:
   - On-device and cloud-based speech recognition
   - Multi-language support and accent adaptation
   - Confidence scoring and uncertainty quantification
   - Context-aware transcription for improved accuracy

3. **Natural Language Understanding**:
   - Intent classification and entity extraction
   - Dialogue state tracking and context management
   - Ambiguity resolution and clarification requests
   - Command validation against safety and feasibility constraints

4. **Action Planning and Execution**:
   - Task decomposition into primitive robot actions
   - Motion planning and collision avoidance
   - Resource allocation and priority management
   - Multi-modal action selection (navigation, manipulation, communication)

5. **ROS 2 Integration Layer**:
   - Real-time communication and message passing
   - Safety-critical system interfaces
   - Distributed processing coordination
   - Fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms

6. **Human-Robot Interaction Feedback**:
   - Multi-modal response generation (speech, gesture, display)
   - Execution monitoring and progress reporting
   - Error recovery and graceful degradation
   - Continuous learning from interaction outcomes

The diagram demonstrates how voice commands are processed through multiple sophisticated layers to enable natural, reliable interaction with humanoid robots in real-world environments.

# Introduction to Physical AI and Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI and Robotics Learning Path**. This comprehensive guide will take you through the fundamentals of robotics, artificial intelligence, and their intersection in creating intelligent physical systems.

## Getting Started with Physical AI and Robotics

Begin your journey by understanding the core concepts of physical AI - where artificial intelligence meets real-world physical systems. Learn how robots perceive, reason, and act in physical environments.

This learning path covers everything from basic robot simulation to advanced AI algorithms that enable robots to interact intelligently with their environment.

### What you'll need

- Understanding of basic programming concepts (Python recommended)
- Familiarity with mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Access to robotics simulation environments (Gazebo, ROS)
- Basic knowledge of physics and mechanics

## Physical AI Fundamentals

Explore the core principles of Physical AI - where artificial intelligence algorithms are applied to control physical systems like robots. Learn how AI enables robots to:

- Perceive their environment through sensors
- Reason about their actions and surroundings
- Plan and execute complex tasks
- Adapt to changing conditions

The intersection of AI and robotics creates systems that can operate autonomously in complex physical environments.

## Learning Path Structure

This learning path is organized into progressive levels:

- **Beginners Level**: Core concepts, basic robot programming, and simple AI algorithms
- **Intermediate Level**: Advanced robotics concepts, sensor integration, and complex AI behaviors
- **Module 1-4**: Deep dive into specific topics like Gazebo simulation, ROS integration, and humanoid robotics

Start with the Beginners Level to build a solid foundation in Physical AI and Robotics.

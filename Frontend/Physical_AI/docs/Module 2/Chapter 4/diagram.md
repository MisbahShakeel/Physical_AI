[Diagram: Physical AI - Multimodal AI Integration Architecture for Embodied Intelligence]

This diagram presents the multimodal AI integration architecture for embodied intelligence in Physical AI systems. The visualization encompasses:

- **Language Processing**: Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language understanding and command interpretation
- **Visual Processing**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for scene understanding and visual reasoning
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Integration of linguistic and visual inputs for comprehensive world modeling
- **Planning Interface**: High-level task planning and decomposition based on AI interpretations
- **Execution Layer**: Translation of AI decisions into ROS 2 control commands
- **Feedback Systems**: Sensory feedback integration to refine AI interpretations and actions

The diagram demonstrates how advanced AI models can be integrated with robotic systems to create intelligent, responsive robots capable of understanding and acting in complex real-world environments through natural language and visual interfaces.

[Diagram: Physical AI - Real-Time Computer Vision Pipeline for Robotic Perception and Action]

This diagram presents the real-time computer vision pipeline architecture for robotic perception and action in Physical AI systems. The visualization details:

- **Image Acquisition**: Camera interfaces and sensor data capture at appropriate frame rates
- **Preprocessing**: Image enhancement, noise reduction, and calibration correction
- **Feature Extraction**: Detection of edges, corners, objects, and semantic elements
- **Scene Understanding**: Object recognition, pose estimation, and environment interpretation
- **Action Mapping**: Conversion of visual information to navigation and manipulation commands
- **Integration Layer**: ROS 2 interfaces connecting vision outputs to robot control systems

The diagram demonstrates how computer vision enables robots to perceive and interact with their environment, forming a critical component of autonomous robotic systems in Physical AI applications.

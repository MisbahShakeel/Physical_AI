[Diagram: Physical AI - Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion Architecture for Humanoid Robot Perception]

This diagram illustrates the multi-modal sensor fusion architecture for humanoid robot perception systems in Physical AI applications. The visualization encompasses:

- **LiDAR Systems**: 2D/3D Light Detection and Ranging sensors for accurate distance measurements and environment mapping
- **Depth Cameras**: RGB-D sensors providing color and depth information for object recognition and scene understanding
- **Sensor Placement**: Strategic positioning for optimal field of view and minimal blind spots
- **Data Fusion**: Integration of multiple sensor inputs for robust environmental perception
- **Processing Pipeline**: Real-time sensor data processing and interpretation for navigation and interaction

The diagram demonstrates how combining multiple sensing modalities enhances robot perception capabilities, enabling reliable operation in complex, dynamic environments for autonomous navigation and human-robot interaction.

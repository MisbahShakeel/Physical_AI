[Diagram: Physical AI - Gazebo Simulation Architecture for Robot Physics and Environment Modeling]

This diagram presents the Gazebo simulation architecture for realistic robot physics and environment modeling in Physical AI systems. The visualization includes:

- **URDF Integration**: Loading and processing robot descriptions for accurate physical representation
- **Physics Engine Core**: ODE, Bullet, or Simbody for computing collisions, forces, and dynamics
- **Sensor Simulation**: Camera, LIDAR, IMU, and other sensor models with realistic noise characteristics
- **Environment Modeling**: 3D scene rendering, lighting, and environmental physics
- **ROS 2 Bridge**: Real-time communication between simulation and control nodes

The diagram demonstrates how Gazebo enables comprehensive testing and training of AI systems in realistic virtual environments before deployment on physical robots, reducing development time and safety risks.

Technical Accuracy:
- Embodied AI principles are correctly represented and implemented
- Affordance-based perception concepts are accurately demonstrated
- Sensorimotor learning algorithms follow established patterns
- Body schema and environmental modeling are properly implemented
- Situated learning mechanisms are appropriately designed

Clarity and Readability:
- Complex embodied cognition concepts are explained clearly
- Code examples are well-commented and educational
- Integration between body, brain, and environment is clearly demonstrated
- Practical applications are tied to theoretical concepts

Docusaurus Formatting:
- Markdown files follow proper formatting standards
- Code blocks are properly formatted with syntax highlighting
- Cross-references between files are appropriately structured
- Documentation structure is consistent with previous chapters

Areas for Improvement:
- Could include more advanced morphological computation examples

command: /sp.plan "You are the Curriculum Planning Engine operating under /sp.constitution and /sp.specify. Your task is to generate the FINAL structural roadmap of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook using the EXACT Modules and Topics defined below. You are NOT allowed to rename, merge, remove, or reorder any Module or Chapter focus. LOCKED MODULE STRUCTURE (NON-NEGOTIABLE): MODULE 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Focus: Middleware for robot control. Chapters must be built ONLY from: 1. ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services 2. Bridging Python Agents to ROS Controllers using rclpy 3. Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for Humanoids 4. Integration of ROS 2 Control with Humanoid Actuators MODULE 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) Focus: Physics simulation and environment building. Chapters must be built ONLY from: 1. Simulating Physics, Gravity, and Collisions in Gazebo 2. Sensor Simulation: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs 3. High-Fidelity Rendering and Human–Robot Interaction in Unity 4. Synchronizing Gazebo and Unity for Digital Twin Environments MODULE 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) Focus: Advanced perception and training. Chapters must be built ONLY from: 1. NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic Simulation & Synthetic Data 2. Isaac ROS: Hardware-Accelerated VSLAM & Navigation 3. Nav2: Path Planning for Bipedal Humanoid Movement 4. Training & Deploying AI Policies from Simulation to Real Robots MODULE 4: Vision–Language–Action (VLA) Focus: The convergence of LLMs and Robotics. Chapters must be built ONLY from: 1. Voice-to-Action Using OpenAI Whisper 2. Cognitive Planning Using LLMs for ROS 2 Action Sequencing 3. Vision–Language–Action Control Loop Integration 4. Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid /sp.plan MUST OUTPUT: FOR EACH MODULE: - Official Module Title - Technical Focus - Entry Skill Level - Exit Skill Level FOR EACH CHAPTER: - Exact Chapter Title - Core Competency Gained - Technical Dependencies - Prerequisites from Previous Modules ALSO GENERATE: - A Skill Progression Matrix mapping: Beginner -> Intermediate across all 4 Modules - A Dependency Graph summary in text form OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY): # MODULE 1: [Title] ## Focus: ## Entry Level: ## Exit Level: ### Chapter 1: ### Chapter 2: ### Chapter 3: ### Chapter 4: (Repeat for all 4 Modules) # SKILL PROGRESSION MATRIX # DEPENDENCY GRAPH SUMMARY STRICT ENFORCEMENT: - No content writing. - No tutorials. - No examples. - No code. - No projects. - Structural planning only. - Must follow the locked module list exactly. - Must obey all /sp.constitution and /sp.specify laws. BEGIN FINAL STRUCTURE GENERATION NOW." -->

## Response snapshot

Confirmed that the structural roadmap for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook" is already generated and saved to `specs/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook/plan.md`. The plan adheres to the locked module structure, chapter titles, and includes a skill progression matrix and dependency graph summary.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Confirmed existence and adherence of the project plan to the specified structure.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 0 files created/modified (plan already exists)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with content generation or task breakdown based on the confirmed plan.
- 🧠 Reflection: User provided an identical request, so the agent confirmed the existing plan and created a PHR.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment: N/A
